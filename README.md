# StormReporter (2012 v 0.1a)
AUTHORS: Tyrell Cushman, Changmin Shen and Scott Trevorrow</br>
DATE: May, 2012

#Purpose
The National Weather Service (NWS) handles severe weather report processing in a particularly old-school fashion. The most effective media for these reports, to date, have been
</br><UL>
<LI>Phone conversations with NWS meteoroloigsts at local NWS stations, and
<LI>Emails
</UL>
These methods require a considerable amount of time to both submit/receive a single storm report and QC the hundreds of reports submitted to a NWS station on an active severe weather day. This, believe it or not, increases risk for citizens living in a region of active severe weather, since the NWS relies on such ground-truth to validate and submit warnings to the public (minus tornado warning which are radar indicated).  The slower the reports come in, the slower the NWS can confirm/deny what radar is showing them. What storm spotters, local officials, and weather enthusiasts need is a method to report severe weather that improves upon existing reporting methods and ultimately helps save lives by providing the NWS with more rapid and reliable severe weather information.  This is the purpose of the StormReporter Android application.</br></br>
